# Changelog

Notable changes to the Leviii AI platform and its documentation. Newest first. Derived from
git history on `feat/phase1-production-hardening`.

## Unreleased — Documentation & hardening (2026-07-11)

### Added
- **Trust documentation set** under `docs/`: Control Evidence Matrix, Technical & Client
  Trust Centers, Architecture, Engineering Standards, Operations & Reliability, AI
  Governance, Threat Model + Risk Register, Compliance Matrix, FAQ, ADRs, this changelog,
  and a tech-debt register. Grounded in the codebase; operational actuals marked TBD.
- **Legal-pack redline change-list** for the externally-generated 12-document legal set.
- **RBAC enforcement** — `require_role` dependency applied to admin-sensitive routes
  (data export/erasure, `/api/v1/ai/usage`, restaurant profile) with `test_rbac.py`.
- **Password policy at registration** — minimum 8 chars incl. letters + digits.
- Argon2id variant pinned explicitly (`argon2__type="ID"`).

### Changed
- **AI documentation reconciled with shipped code** across the doc set (architecture,
  AI governance, ADR 0005, both trust centers, control-evidence matrix, threat model,
  compliance matrix, engineering standards, FAQ): the LLM is now documented as used in
  **two** non-computing roles — WhatsApp free-text **and** a grounded reasoning/narration
  layer over the deterministic analytics — with the "LLM never computes" invariant and the
  grounding-redaction control stated explicitly, plus the Groq→Anthropic Claude tiered
  upgrade path.

### Notes
- Full backend test suite: **206 passing**.

## Prior (from git history)

- `79908e8` — AIOps: `GET /api/v1/ai/usage` (token spend, agent latency, grounding).
- `638a61a` — `/api/v1` versioning + JWT session revocation (`token_version`).
- `29f188b` — Fail-closed startup config guard + green test suite.
- `cb97fae` — Stock-alert tests pinned to deterministic service hours.
- `4362786` — DB integrity constraints + disaster-recovery runbook.

## Conventions

- Group entries under Added / Changed / Fixed / Security.
- Reference the commit or PR. Move "Unreleased" to a dated version on release.
